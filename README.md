A Visual Studio Code extension that integrates with the xAI API to allow developers to ask Grok questions about their codebase directly within the editor. Get insights on your entire workspace, specific files, functions, or selected code snippets with ease.

## Features

- **Ask Grok: Workspace** - Query Grok about your entire project to get a comprehensive overview or solve cross-file issues.
- **Ask Grok: Current Tab** - Focus on the active file and ask questions specific to its content.
- **Ask Grok: Function Under Cursor** - Get explanations or suggestions for the function or method at your cursor position.
- **Ask Grok: Selected Text** - Highlight code and ask Grok for insights or assistance on just that selection.
- **Customizable Output** - Choose to display Grok's responses in a new editor tab or the Output panel.
- **Data Preview** - Review the data being sent to the Grok API before submission, with configurable settings for when previews appear.
- **Model Selection** - Select from a variety of Grok models (e.g., `grok-2`, `grok-3-fast`) to suit your needs.
