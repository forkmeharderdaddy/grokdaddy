## Version 0.0.5 (March 01, 2025)

### Added

- New configuration options in `package.json`:

  - `vscodeGrok.showPreview`: Controls when a preview of data sent to Grok API is shown ('always', 'workspace-only', 'never'). Defaults to 'workspace-only'.
- New command: `vscode-grok.askGrokSelection`
  - Allows users to ask Grok questions about selected text in the active editor tab.

  - `src/const.ts`: Centralized constants for API URL, configuration keys, and preview settings.
  - `src/context.ts`: Context preparation logic for workspace, API key, model, and question.
  - `src/display.ts`: Handles displaying Grok responses in either tabs or output channel.
  - `src/editor.ts`: File and editor utility functions (file reading, active tab/function/selection handling).
  - `src/exclude-list.ts`: Defines files to exclude (e.g., `package-lock.json`).
  - `src/git.ts`: Git utility functions for file listing and diff operations.
  - `src/message.ts`: Constructs prompts for different query types (workspace, tab, function, selection).
  - `src/preview.ts`: Implements data preview functionality before sending to Grok API.
  - `src/types.ts`: Type definitions for message types, Grok choices, and context.
  - `src/ui.ts`: UI utility functions for prompting and progress display.
